----------

Spacey is a project which contains some 'test the waters' code.

We are interested in these:

JOOQ (No-Hibernate, better integration with SQL server, ability to fine tune SQL statements)

REST (JAX-RS -> RestEasy or Jersey, Maybe Restlet?)

Guice, we need to have good DI which enables good testing.

Mockito, because it makes mocking in Java simple.

Server Sent Events, allow clients to connect and stay connected and receive data! A very easy to integrate with way to federate data.

Websockets, would be very useful in communication scenarios which we definitely would like to pursue.
